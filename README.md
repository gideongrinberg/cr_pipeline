# Complex Rotator Detection Pipeline

## Structure

TO DO

## Testing

The scripts in `tests/` run the pipeline against a 41 known complex rotators and 15 non-complex objects (10 stars with transiting exoplanets and 5 eclipsing binaries), for a total of 295 distinct sectors. 

The pipeline accurately identifies around 88% of complex rotators. Some of the objects it fails to identify are of ambigious complexity, such as TIC 65347864.
